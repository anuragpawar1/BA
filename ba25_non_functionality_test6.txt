3.Security test - 
  1.Authorisation - verifying user is valid or not
  2.access control - Role based access security systeam

 testing duration - 2,3 days (critical info) before project goes to production.

 note - always use credential word for getting info from devloper.
        during security testing we perform frontend and backend testing
        automation testing no entry zone

 
4.Performance test - it is an advance testing technique and complex to conduct , because huge enviorment is
  required.
  During this test we validate speed of processing of the application or systeam. 
  
  cause- a.frontend 1.devloper wrong logic 2.declaration of class 3.object
         b.backend  1.backend wrong logic 2.wrong schema validation 3.wrong datatype declaration 4.shortest path 
                                                                                                 detection
         c.when no of user is incresed
  
..load testing - the exicution of our application with customer expected configuration and customer expected load
  to estimate the performance is called as load testing.
  
..stress testing - the exicution of our application with customer expected configuration and customer expected 
  load and peak load , to estimate the performance is called stress testing. (vvimp)
  The main objective of stress testing is , to indentify threshould point or breakeven point.

  It is used for enhancement purpose, no users might be increse in near future hence identifying  breakeven point
  is most important from bussness prospective point of view.

..Endurance test - 24,48,72 hr observation. how much time application can bear the customer expected load with 
  respect to time is known as endurance test. 
  
  During endurance test we analyis and monitor memory consumption to determine potential failure.

..data volume testing - 
  It is also called as flood testing.This testing is related to huge volume of data. During this test we validate 
  the systeam performance by incresing/decresing the volume of data in data container.
   
  During this test we concentrate on various factor 1.response time 2.Systeam behaviour

..Storage testing - 
  During this testing we verify 1.wheather it has enough space to prevent unexpected termination
                                2.specific data is getting stored in appropriate directories or not
                               

what is the difference between  issue , defect , bug , error ?

error- a mistake in the code is called an error due to this error mismatch occurs.
defect -due to this error mismatch occur is called as defect.
bug - when this defect accepted by devloper is called as Bug.
issue - sometime some defects are called as issue (neither it is acepted by devloper and rejected by tester)

known issue - defect which is already exist in systeam due to environmental factor
