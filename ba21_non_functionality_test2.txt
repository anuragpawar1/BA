..compatibility test - 
  It is also known as portability test. During this test we check wheather our application compatable with customer
  expected platform or not.
  
  customer expected platform - mongo db , cloud , chrome , unix

  Data Migration
   
  I have invovled in browser compatibility. 
    cross-browsing compatibility (chrome vs IE , chrome vs firefox , chrome vs safari)
    
    version comparison ( IE9 vs IE10)  we use [vm-wire] virtual machine software to compare on same laptop.

 Requirment:
   duration 3 months
   cross-browsing compatibility (chrome vs IE , chrome vs firefox , chrome vs safari)
   1 candidate for 1 browser
 
 Note - This testing is only applicable for frontend validation. you are not involved in backend. 
  
  During cross browsing compatibility we concentrate on - 1.Hyperlink accessbility
                                                          2.Page navigation
