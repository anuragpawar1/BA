2.Functional Testing:-
 classified into two types- a.functionality b.non-functionality

a.Functionality testing is considerd as one of the major part of black box testing. During this test we concentrate 
 on we validate functionality of system or application wrt customer requirement.

 During functionality testing we concentrate on various coverage analysis.
 
..behaveioural coverage - (to check objects property)
    objects          function                     properties
    text box --------Enter   -------------------- focus/unfoused , enabled/disabled 
    list box---------Select  -------------------- multiple element can be used at a time ,focus/unfoused
    combo box--------Select  -------------------- one element can be used at a time , focus/unfoused                           
    radio button-----click ---------------------- on or off / or
    check box--------click ---------------------- check or uncheck
    button-----------click ---------------------- focus/unfoused , enabled/disabled 
    hyperlink--------click----------------------- access

 ..input domain testing - (to check type  and size of input objects)
    It is applicable only for text box.
    type/class - BVA (Boundary Value Analysis)        size/length - ECP(Equivalance class Partition)
     min-1 min min+1---------max-1 max max+1

 ..error handling coverage - (preventing negative navigation)
 ..backend coverage - (impact of content wrt user operation)
 ..service level coverage - (sequence of functionality)
 ..calculation based coverage - (validating arithmatic logic)
