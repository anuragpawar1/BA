Build Upgradation Activity :- 
  build will come friday after 6pm close of buissness.
  
 Q.How we recive the build?
 A.Devloper deploy local build on softbase/build server and we recive the build via FTP and they share us ip address.
  (Friday evening we get email of ip addres - Hi team,
                                              please find build line 26.0 is kept at @172.34.56.24 
                                              and start test operation activity)

  object synchronisation process with sever = build upgradtion
 
  once we recive the initial build we send it to platform team for build upgradation activity. Platform team implement 
  compilaton process to handle build upgradation activity.
  Once it done, platform team share log file with valid and invalid objects. After that we need to analysis  which
  object needs to be re-validate and request platform team to re-compile.
     (it will be done till 10am monday)
   
 smoke vs sanity testing - 

..package validation - (we do it on monday) 
  Platform team create the packages
  
  sanity = level 0/testability/acceptibility/build verification test.
  During sanity test we validate core and basic functionality of the systeam or we check wheather the systeam is 
  ready for testing or not . i mean stability of build or systeam. Other day test is called comprehensive test.
  
  sanity test duration = 1 day
 
  Fundamental core functonality of any systeam is static by nature.

  Q.Do you write test case of sanity testing?
  A.sir what i understand during sanity test we validate core and basic functonality of any systeam which is static by 
    nature. For core and basic functionality we design test case during initial satage of systeam devlopment.Means 
    we involve in exicution only.

  Generally during sanity test we find enviromental related defect are maximum. it means 1.Run time error
  2.dll file missing 3.404 issue

  Q.Do you register defect in tool?
  A.Generally we register high critical defect rest we share with devloper via email(only for sanity)


  During Sanity we concentrate on - 
  1.hyperlink acessbility
  2.performance
  3.user face validation
  4.core functionality
  5.page navigation
  6.tab validation
