complition of wb testing

v model - v stsnds for verification and validation. this model defines mapping between verification and validation.
          It looks like v. life cycle devlopment lcd and lct

brs: requrement gathering                                         test plan: assesment of adoption of devlopment document
        and analysis
 



dre - defect removal efficiency

cr - change request 0r rfc - request for change   

advantage - 1. depolyment and 
disadvantage - 1.expensive model 2. applicable for high cost client
      
note:- basically who is going to decide ..genarally the process implementation is decide by clint based on nature and behaviour 
        of project. 

it is high cost model because for testing there are multiple stages are implemented in v model

Pet (Process export tools and technique) Process:- for small and medium companny . it is devlopedd by hcl and 
reconized by qa firm of india

 in this stage model insted of multilpe stage of testing single stage is implemented. to reduce the cost

refination form of v model



****Waterfall Model - It looks like waterfall, also called as linear sequential model.
Model defines each phase purely depends on delivarables of privious phase.
