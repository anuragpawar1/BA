..smoke tetsing - 
  smoke = sanity + trouble shoot . I mean to say we try to trouble shoot when build gets failed. Generally we 
   identifie where the exact issue when our build gets failed.
   
  During smoke testing we perform package validation. assume during exicution we identify the issue we have to
  identify object belongs to which package. We request platform team to recompile the package.

note - we work on traditional architechture so we do sanity and smoke on monday itself.
