Automation : - 
 if we analyse regression testing means re-exicution and retesting means re-exicution , it means re-exicution is a 
 comman factor , that is repetation.
 In comman testing practice,we implement test automation with respect to test impact and test criticality.
 
 test impact - test repetation
 test criticality - complex to test manually 

 if we implement automation advantage will be - 1.less time 2.less resorce utilisation 3.avoid human error

 systeam integration and backend cant apply automation.
 
note - data migrate only when there is technology chhange or systeam configuration change.
