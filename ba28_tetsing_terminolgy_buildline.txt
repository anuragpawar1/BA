Testing terminology - 

 1.Monkey/Speed testing - max task wrt less time
   we conduct/perform monkey testing on high and basic priority functionality test case , when we have  max task
   wrt less time.

 2.Gorilla/frustation/torture Testing - we apply the same inputs on the same module to validate the functionality 
   to ensure there are no bug exist. The main objective is to test specific module 50 60 times. (tolerance testing)
   
   When product is high coast above testing used.

 3.Explorotory Testing - when domain is diffrent use this testing, we have to explore functionality. 
   Level by level functionality coverage. i mean to say simultenious learning , test design and exicution.

 4.Ad-hoc Testing - If we dont have sufficent test data,(srs is not avialabe, we can test)
   It is nothing but mechanisam used when we dont have sufficent test data.


Build Architechture - 
  on 1 release  we get 4-5 build. Build going to client called master build line.

 Q.How to identify your build version?
 Ans:- select * from build_version
       date            version
       26 april,2022   26  
       03 may ,2022    27 (insted of 27 we get 28 directly then it is very high (version control) critical defect)

 current version + 1 = close of defect. (identified in 26 and closed in 27.0) , if not resolved reopen defect.

 Blocker defect - without fixing this we can not validate the systeam. (oreder id is not getting generated)
                  (high priority,immediate fix)
