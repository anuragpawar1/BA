Bigbang Testing(Informal testing) - one big shot, one major functionality from start to end we need to test.
  
  During this test we concentrate on a single stage to validate the functionality insted of multiple stages after
  completion of entire systeam devlopment. 
  
  It is done before goes to production and after SIT testing. 

  eg.Invoice generation

Formal Test/Incremental test - 
  During this test we concentrate on level by level functionality coverage from unit level to systeam level.
  we validate the functionality from unit level to systeam level.


Retesting - 
  reexicution of our application/systeam on same build to validate the functionality with different set of input
  data combination.

  I mean to say we implement data intelligance to perform testing.During this test we apply multi diamentional 
  data analytic approch.
  
  Q.Differance between retesting and regressiom?
  A.for very first time we are doing retesting after that retesting called as regression. Every regression test
    can be retesting but every retesting might not be regression test.
    
    what i understand retesting and regression is just an approch.

Regression test -

  Once we recive the intial build we start exicution, if we find any defect we send it to devloper. Devloper will
  fix the defect and once we recive modified build we check wheather the existing defect gets resolved not or any 
  side effect occured. 
  
  generally we do re-exicution of application/systeam on modified build to check bug fix work and
  occurances of side effect.

 note - old defect testing is also called regression test

  Generally in every testing cycle,we perform regression test twice. 1.During comprehensive test 2.Post SIT
  
  During regression we concentrate on SIT failed test case , newly added scenario , high prority test case ,
  if time permits inter dependent test case.

  re-exicution is a comman factor, re-exicution means repetation it means probablity of implementation of 
  automation is maximum.

note - automation will apllied only if there is 1.repetation 2.stand alone architecture
