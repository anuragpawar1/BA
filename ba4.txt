if we analyze the hdlc model then srs is reviewd by BA. degin will be revived by the devloper and this is white box testing.
it is called as veerification or static testing. We perform sys and functional testing i mean to say
functionality of sys,is called as black box testing.  

i mean irespective of any stage defect we are reposnsible for dynamic defect i.e it can be req defect it can be design code defect.
 
what is diff btween static and dynamic testing ? verification and validation?

dev review code during wb testing then what is importance of black box testing?
devloper concentrate on presenc e of defect in code but in bb testing test engg focuses on presence as well as 
 defect . i mean to say we have to concentrate on positive and negative condition.
during wb testing dev concentrate on 2 dimensional concept
                                 blb testing - 3 diamentional testing

3 diamension = buissness logic

hdlc = verification + validation without verification validation is not possible and without validation quality 
software is not possible.
