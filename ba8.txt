lekage defect - lets assume in sit 80 we identify defect and in uit we identify 30 defect . this defect we will analuzed 
 out of this 30 20 will be old and 10 are new . this defect known as defect lekage.

existing defect - 1.way of representation 2. devloper mistake 

what  is defect removal efficency - a/a+b a= defect indentified during sit and b = defect identified during uit
   80/80+30 ratio is numerator is always less than denominator i.e genalrry 0.8 to 0.9 is goofd efficiency

gap analysis - aactual and desired efficency is a matrix is used to analyse the gap betwwen two concecutive stage\
               of the organization systeam.
